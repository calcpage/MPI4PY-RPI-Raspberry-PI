# MPI-RPI
Building and programming a Linux Cluster made up of Raspberry PIs! 
We started with hello_serial.py just to get used to python on RPIs. 
Then we added MPI to it in hello_mpi.py. 
Then we ran flops.f from pelican HPC on our RPI to see how it worked. 
mypi_serial.py and mypi_mpi is our translation of flops.f quadrature section from fortran to python. 
Next we will try to make our own mandelbrot fractal: mandel_serial.py and mandel_mpi.py!
